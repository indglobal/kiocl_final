				<p><strong>Bangalore, May 31, 2013:</strong></p>		
            <p class="text-justify">As per the financial results for the year 2012-13 recently approved by its Board of Directors, ITI has recorded lowest ever losses during the last 11 years. The company has registered a loss of Rs. 182 Cr. for the year 2012-13 against a loss of Rs. 370 Cr. for the previous year 2011-12, i.e. a reduction of around 50%.
<br>
<br>
Not only this, the Company has recorded a profit of Rs. 110 Cr. in the last quarter of 2012-13. This is in-spite of the fact that their major two customers, i.e. BSNL and MTNL, are now into losses for the last four years continuously and their losses have been going up. This reduction in the losses is before the sanction of the Draft Rehabilitation Scheme (DRS). The Company is hopeful that after the approval of Draft Rehabilitation Scheme (DRS), which is now under the consideration of Dept. of Telecommunications as well as Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE), the Company will be back to profit from the year 2014-15 onwards.
<br>
<br>
Coupled with the reduction in the losses, rating of ITI on the MoU signed by the PSU with the Administrative Ministry, i.e. Dept. of Telecommunications, also has been improving during the last four years consecutively. The Management of the Company is pinning its hopes of reviving this chronically sick company on the strength of recently announced National Telecom Policy-2012 by the Govt. of India and National Policy of Electronics as well as diversification into newer areas. Though the order book of the Company from BSNL/MTNL (its traditional customers)has been shrinking, but the new initiatives of the Company have helped ITI to earn higher margins as compared to its traditional business with BSNL/MTNL.
<br>
<br>
The reduction in the losses of ITI Ltd. consecutively for the last four years and its reduction of losses in 2012-13 to all time low during the last 11 years and improvement of its MoU score to all time high score during the last 11 years is seen as a positive development in the telecom sectors and also in Dept. of Telecommunications.</p>
