			<p class="text-justify"><strong>Bangalore, May 31, 2014:</strong></p>
			<p class="text-justify">ITI, the Telecom PSU of the country, has reported a loss of Rs.344 Crore excluding grants for the just ended financial year, 2013-14. This is the lowest loss reported in the last twelve years from 2002-03 onwards, since when it has been into losses. This is the result of the tight financial discipline taken in the last four years by the company including many cost reduction measures.
<br>
<br>
ITI is poised for turning around once the financial assistance in the form of Revival Package sanctioned by the Government of India is received. Earlier, Government of India has sanctioned Revival Package for upgrading its manufacturing facilities and clearing its balance sheet.
<br>
<br>
In addition to this lowest losses reported the companyâ€™s MoU score for year 2013-14 is expected to be the best in the last twelve years. These improvements in its performance have given a boost in its efforts towards revival of the company. The Revival Package approved by the Government, helps ITI in the up-gradation of its ageing manufacturing facilities. The company also has diversification plans to foray into non-telecommunication areas of business and reduce its dependence on BSNL/MTNL. The state-of-the-art facilities post up-gradation coupled with new areas of business would help ITI in faster turn-around. ITI is also banking on the business opportunities which are expected to emerge from the National Telecom Policy and National Policy on Electronics.
<br>
<br>
The reduction of the losses by ITI is seen as a positive development towards revival of this ailing telecom giant in the Telecom Sector.</p>
