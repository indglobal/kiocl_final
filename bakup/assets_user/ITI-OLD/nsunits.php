<h4 style="font-weight:600;color: #43467B;"> Army Static Switch Communication Network (ASCON ) Project for Ministry of Defence</h4>
<p class="text-justify">The Company’s thrust on the speedy implementation of ARMY projects has resulted us in gateway to ITI to make our defence road map longer by repeat orders from Ministry of Defence for Indian Army project. ASCON is the country’s prestigious Army backbone communication Telecom Network implemented in phases along the Borders. The network consists of large no. of Voice and Data switches inter connected with various media types like microwave radio, OFC, satellite. The Phase I, Phase II and Phase III of the Network has already been established by ITI on Turnkey basis and handed over to the Army. At present the network of all phases is being maintained by the company under AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract). ASCON network uses state-of-the art ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) switches, Satellite media, PAMA (Permanently Assigned Multiple Access) and DAMA (Demand Assigned Multiple Access), Microwave Radio, PDH (Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy) and SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) and Optical Fiber communication (OFC) upto STM - 4 (Synchronous Transfer Mode level). ASCON Network is secured using Bulk Encryption. The project includes civil works for providing complete infrastructure required at various stations in addition to supply, installation, commissioning and Maintanence of Telecom equipment, Satcom equipment, Optical Fiber Cables and equipments. In accordance with plan for phased expansion of network, ITI submitted Expression of Interest (EOI) to Indian Army to extend ASCON Network through a Turnkey project of Phase-IV which will be PAN-India including different terrains at Northern, North-eastern and Western region as well as locations in the hinter land. The Network will be DWDM and IP/MPLS based backbone Network with suppoting value added services including Video Conferencing, Broad cast and multicast facilities.</p>

<div class="opener1">
<h4 style="font-weight:600;   color: #43467B;"> VSAT Based Broadband Aceess Network In Ku- Band</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Given the expertise of Network Systems Unit (NSU) of ITI LIMITED in the areas of system integration, procurement, installation, commissioning and maintenance aided by the nation wide presence of its Units and offices. NSU embarked on implementing VSAT based Broad band Access network for BSNL. An MOU to this effect was signed with BSNL to handle this project on revenue sharing basis. The project involved setting up of a HUB at Bangalore and commissioning of VSATs at 200 locations initially. Currently VSAT base is nearing the 3500 mark. And expected to reach higher figures further. With this strategic alliance, NSU has made its debut into a new area of building infrastructure for IP- base Satellite based Broadband services. These services are available for both corporate users in large cities and to remote areas where OFC/Cables do not exist. Services include data and Video connectivity for business critical applications like connecting all remote branches/ATMs of bank to its main server location, voice connectivity through VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), Internet upto 2 Mbps, extension of existing MLLN (Managed Leased Line Network) and VPN (Virtual Private Network) services of business enterprise. High power Ku-Band transponders, in INSAT are being employed for providing the above services. The HUB among other items boasts of having a 24x7 Customers Helpdesk to attend to any customer complaint and a data center for hoisting any customer database.</p>
