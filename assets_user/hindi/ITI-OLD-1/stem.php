		  	<p class="text-justify iconLeft">STM-1 (ITI- TJ100MC-1) is part of a family of Multi-Service Provisioning Platform and Access Nodes. The TJ100MC-1 MSPP also supports end-to-end provisioning and management of voice and data services across all the segments of the optical network - from the customer premises to the core. It combines innovative optical networking software with the intelligence of SDH to deliver a flexible solution to today's service providers.</p>
		  	<p class="text-justify iconLeft">The TJ100MC-1 can be configured as Terminal Multiplexers (TMUX) or Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADM), with mix-and-match tributary interfaces at E1, E3, DS3 or 10/100 Mbps Ethernet service interfaces. The product has a built in non-blocking cross-connect at VC-3 and VC-12 granularity for efficient traffic grooming. 
			In view of the growing demand for packet services, TJ100MC-1 provides rate controlled 10/100 Base-T interfaces to carry inter-office traffic from corporate LANs, campus networks, or from Internet Service Providers.</p>
