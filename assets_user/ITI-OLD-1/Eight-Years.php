				<p><strong>Bangalore, Dec 3, 2010:</strong></p>		
            <p class="text-justify">ITI Ltd has reported its lowest ever half yearly losses in eight years by reporting the net loss of Rs. 123.81 crores for the six month period ending September 30, 2010.

<br>
<br>
Earlier this year, ITI Ltd reported its lowest ever quarterly losses in eight years by reporting the net loss of Rs. 63.83 crores for the first quarter of 2010-11 as against Rs. 107.78 crores in Q1 2009-10.
