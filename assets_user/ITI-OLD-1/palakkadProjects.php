		  	<p class="text-justify iconLeft">The Signaling Transfer Point (STP) system is a digital system used in the telecommunication network for transfer of signaling data between telecommunication system (mobile exchanges, local exchanges, trunk exchanges etc). Signaling data is the information related to calls between subscribers or those related to management of calls or network management messages. The Short Message Service (SMS), widely used in the mobile network is also treated as signaling data. The STP system acts as a transit system for the transfer of Signaling data from one location to a distant location through defined transmission network. The capacity of a STP system is measured by the equipped capacity of narrow band signaling link (64 kbps) as well as high speed signaling link (2Mbps). </p>
		  	<p class="text-justify iconLeft">ITI Palakkad has set up the Stand Alone Signaling Transfer Point Network (SSTP) for the State owned operator, BSNL, covering the entire country.
